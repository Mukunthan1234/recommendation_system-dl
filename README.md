E-Commerce Product Recommendation System using Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)

A deep learning–based recommendation system built using Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) to generate personalized product recommendations for users. The system is trained on Amazon Electronics Review data and predicts user–item interactions using learned embeddings and multi-layer perceptrons (MLP).

**Project Overview**

This project replicates a real-world recommendation pipeline similar to those used in modern e-commerce platforms. It uses implicit feedback, user–item embeddings, negative sampling, and a Neural Collaborative Filtering architecture to predict purchase intent and generate Top-N product recommendations.

 **Key Features**

Deep Learning–based Neural Collaborative Filtering model

User and item embeddings with MLP layers

Timestamp-based train/validation/test split

Negative sampling for implicit feedback learning

Ability to generate Top-N personalized recommendations for any user

Modular, scalable, and ready for deployment

🛠 Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

📘 Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing

Loaded and cleaned dataset

Encoded users and items into numeric IDs

Sorted interactions by timestamp

Created train, validation, and test splits using a leave-last-two method per user

2. Negative Sampling

Since real-world e-commerce data contains only positive interactions, negative samples were generated by selecting items users did not interact with and labeling them as 0.

3. Neural Collaborative Filtering Model

The NCF model includes:

User Embedding Layer

Item Embedding Layer

Concatenation of embeddings

Multi-Layer Perceptron (128 → 64 → 32 units)

Sigmoid output predicting probability of interaction

4. Evaluation

Binary cross-entropy loss

Accuracy on test set (~72%)

Top-N recommendation ranking

📊 Training Results

Test Accuracy: ~72%

Model successfully predicts high-probability interactions

Capable of generating personalized recommendations

🎯 How to Run
1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Train the model
python main.py

3. Generate recommendations

Example:

from src.predict import recommend_items
recommend_items(user_id=123, top_n=10)

🔍 Future Improvements

Implement NeuMF (GMF + MLP hybrid)

Add sequence-based recommendations (GRU/Transformer)

Integrate product metadata for content-aware recommendations

Deploy model using Flask or FastAPI
